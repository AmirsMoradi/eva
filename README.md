This is a python code about the EVA currency. I tried to use pandas to first retrieve and save the dataset.
After drawing various charts, I did some analysis and finally using a machine learning model I predicted the approximate price from today's date 2024/12/21 to approximately 2024/12/28.
Required libraries:
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
